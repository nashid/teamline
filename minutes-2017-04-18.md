Feedback:
  - Heatmap:
    - saturation (not luminance)

  - Teamline graph
    -

Feedback
  - D1-D3 separately -> see combination of D1 to D3
  - Maybe provide overview on the teamline page (superimpose vs side-by-side)
  - Scale of the number of the deliverable


- Number of assignments
- Number of team members (more than 2)


- More metrics
  - Lines of code/measure of activity (contributions)
  - First comes gets all the credit
  - Variable names (renaming coverage to be student-based tests vs instructor tests)
    - contribution coverage -> personal contribution increase

- Detail chart
 - Label x-axis
 - Visualize things in the tooltips (grade + coverage)
 - Don't show butterfly chart -> felt like have to do a mental flip making it hard to understand

- Differentiate the between the coverage and the pass rate (noting that they are independent variables)

- Another usage case: students can use this

- Have final grade in overview but not in detail view (except in tooltip)!

- Encode divergence in overview
- More info dense overview

- Targeted user feedback/evaluation (from TAs and Instructors)
