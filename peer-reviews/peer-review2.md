## Feedback
  - Breaking tests: negative contribution. Don't need to vis
  - Teams of three: need scalablity?
    - Multiple lines - one for each team
    - Don't need the mirror effect
    - Keep it on the same axis
  - Tests pass: could be that one person did 90% of the work but didn't pass the test; other team member might do last little bit and pass the test.
  - What the student was tasked with (how to account for documentation)?
  - Massive check-ins
  - Vertical timeline
  - Okay to keep bars
  - Use it in industry: want the metrics
  - Heatmp: over time so you can see the team dynamic
  - Refactor: cleaning code -- how to take into account
  - Code churn: should show
    - github snapshot
    - metric: amount of changed code in the code
