%% first page will be refused. Also, the teaser figure should only have the
%% width of the abstract as the template enforces it.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Determining and understanding contributions to a shared code base can be helpful for monitoring developer efficiency, allocating work items and understanding how and why changes were made. To support this task, we introduce a method for deriving contribution using test execution results and code coverage reports. Our visualization tool, Teamline, then presents these metrics in two different views. An overview shows the uniformity of contributions across hundreds of teams. The detail view shows the test pass rate progression and offers a way to compare up to ten contributors at-a-glance with a small-multiples view. Pairs of contributors can selected to get a detailed comparison in a large side-by-side view.
