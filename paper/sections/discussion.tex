Discussion


%% Future Work
% - Evaluate our info vis solution with TAs
% - Capture and include more metrics (esp. LOC + code churn)
% - Finer-grain contributions (less black and white -- if a student does 90\% of the code but their partner makes the commit that passes, they will get all the credit)
%
% - Abstract away AutoTest data so that can be used in industry



%% Limitations
%  - 100% contribution to coverage but coverage grade only increased a few percent
