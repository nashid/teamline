% Determining and understanding contributions to a shared code base can be helpful for monitoring developer efficiency, allocating work items and understanding how and why changes were made. To support this task, we introduce a method for deriving contribution using test execution results and code coverage reports. Our visualization tool, Teamline, then presents these metrics in two different views. An overview shows uniformity contributions across hundreds of teams. The detail view shows the test pass rate progression and offers a way to compare up to ten teams at-a-glance with a small multiples view and to compare contributors pairwise in a large side-by-side view.
